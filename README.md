# upwork-jsonToWord
A Python script that dynamically converts JSON data into a structured Word document (.docx). The script generates five distinct segments, each containing multiple objects, formatted into three tables per segment. Static text is stored in a YAML file for easy modification, and unit tests validate data accuracy.
